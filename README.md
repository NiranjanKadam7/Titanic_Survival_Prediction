# **Titanic_Survival_Prediction**
I started this project to participate in competition on Kaggle.This is machine learning project and aim is to predict what sort of people likely to the survive.The dataset is imported by kaggle platform.



## Data Summary

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.Dataset involves the features like Tickit class, Sex, Age, Siblings/spouces, Parents/children, Tickit Number, Passanger Fare, Cabin number,Port of Embarkation
